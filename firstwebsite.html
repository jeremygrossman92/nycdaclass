 					 	Hi everyone, welcome to my website! My name is Jeremy Grossman, and I'm the digital media manager at Liberty Science Center. I live in Greenwich Village, NYC, but I commute every day to Jersey City for work. Crazy, right?</p>
 				
 				<p>I am an NYU graduate and my background is in writing and journalism. At my job, I manage our website and social media accounts, and create content for these pages to let everyone know about all the cool things happening at the Science Center.</p>

 				 <p>Even though I'm constantly surrounded by digital platforms, I am still very new to coding. I have spent a lot of time using HTML, but CSS and JavaScript are pretty foreign to me. With my new coding education, the possibilities will be endless!</p>

 				 <p>Feel free to follow me on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/jeremy.grossman1" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/jeremygrossman" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, and <a href="http://www.instagram.com/grossmanj4" target="_blank">Instagram</a>, or even on <a href="https://www.yelp.com/user_details_reviews_self?userid=1xDwqHSv8zOLgUZQNZnFQQ" target="_blank">Yelp</a>.</p>
